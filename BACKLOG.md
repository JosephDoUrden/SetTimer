## Build & Deployment (Hour 7–8)
- [X] Prepare Android build (Updated manifest, build.gradle, ProGuard rules, and themes)
- [X] Test Android build (Debug APK builds successfully, ready for device testing)
- [X] Prepare iOS build (Updated Info.plist, Podfile, AppDelegate, and project settings)
- [X] Fix iOS build validation (Removed invalid background modes from Info.plist)
- [X] Optimize build configuration for distribution
- [X] Update app metadata and descriptions
- [X] Fix missing imports and build dependencies
- [ ] Create app store listing assets (screenshots, descriptions)
- [ ] Test iOS build (TestFlight)
- [ ] Publish to Google Play Store
- [ ] Prepare for App Store submission
