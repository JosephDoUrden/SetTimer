# Project Task Backlog: SetTimer MVP

## Project Setup & Initial UI (Hour 1–2)
- [X] Setup Flutter project
- [X] Choose state management (Provider - selected for simplicity and sufficient functionality)
- [X] Select audio player package (flutter_ringtone_player - selected for simplicity and system sound integration)
- [ ] Design and implement basic timer UI
- [ ] Implement UI for setting custom set count
- [ ] Implement UI for setting custom set duration
- [ ] Implement UI for setting rest interval
- [ ] Implement UI for setting rest duration
- [ ] Implement UI for progress tracker (current set / total sets)
- [ ] Implement basic timer controls (start, pause, reset)

## Core Logic (Hour 3–4)
- [ ] Implement logic for custom set count
- [ ] Implement logic for custom set duration
- [ ] Implement logic for automatic rest feature (triggering rest after N sets)
- [ ] Implement logic for rest duration
- [ ] Implement logic for auto-starting the next set after rest or previous set
- [ ] Implement logic for progress tracking (updating current set / total sets)
- [ ] Ensure timer continues in background mode

## Sound & UI Polish (Hour 5–6)
- [ ] Integrate sound alerts for set start
- [ ] Integrate sound alerts for set end
- [ ] Integrate sound alerts for rest period start
- [ ] Integrate sound alerts for rest period end
- [ ] Polish overall UI/UX for a clean interface
- [ ] Ensure one-tap start functionality

## Build & Deployment (Hour 7–8)
- [ ] Prepare Android build
- [ ] Test Android build
- [ ] Prepare iOS build
- [ ] Test iOS build (TestFlight)
- [ ] Publish to Google Play Store
- [ ] Prepare for App Store submission

## Testing & QA (Derived from Success Metrics)
- [ ] Test: App completes all sets and rests automatically without user intervention
- [ ] Test: User does not need to touch the screen mid-workout
- [ ] Test: Simple UX with one-tap start is functional and intuitive
- [ ] Test: Background mode works as expected on both Android and iOS
- [ ] Test: Sound alerts are timely and clear
